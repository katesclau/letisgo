# LETISGO

LETISGO is a robust framework designed to implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
pattern with built-in support for both REST.

This framework aims to simplify the development of scalable and maintainable applications
by separating the read and write operations, thus optimizing performance and scalability.

## Development Setup

To set up the development environment for LETISGO.

### Prerequisites:

TailwindCSS CLI requires watchmand installed, and this may vary depending on your operating system.
check the link below for more information on how to install watchman on your operating system.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/letisgo.git
   cd letisgo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   make prepare
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables.

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   make dev
   ```

## Usage

LETISGO provides a seamless way to handle both REST and GraphQL APIs. Hereâ€™s how you can use it:

### REST API

To define a REST endpoint on `/backend/routes`,
create a controller in the `controllers` directory
and define your routes in the `routes` file.

### Frontend

This framework includes a frontend application built with HTMX, Templ, and Tailwind CSS.
To start the frontend server, run the following command:

```sh
make dev
```
